          The Internet has allowed untrusted people to peel away the layers of your privacy onion without your knowledge or agreement.
          <br /><br />It may seem impossible to protect your privacy but the following suggestions should help.
          There are different levels of privacy. Not everyone will be right for you. The following tips are broken into categories.

          <br></br><br></br>
          Before you start applying some of these suggestions, a useful way of determining what category you fit in is to map your 
          <span className='advice__text--emphasis'> is you</span> and <span className='advice__text--emphasis'>about you</span> data onto a privacy onion. 
          This can help you determine the privacy level you are most comfortable with.

             Use Separate accounts - If you have a large number of accounts and apps that you regularly use, it may be a good idea to use different email addresses for different services.
